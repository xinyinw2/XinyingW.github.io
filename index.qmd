**Hello! Welcome my portfolio website.**
<br>
<br>

## About Me

Master of Science in Business Analytics candidate at the University of California, Irvine’s Paul Merage School of Business with a strong foundation in Business Administration and Computer Information Science from the University of Oregon.

I bring hands-on experience in data analytics, process optimization, and data-driven decision support. As a Business Analyst at Edwards Lifesciences, I developed Python-based automation models to detect anomalies in 190K+ regulatory distribution records, applied SQL and machine learning for pattern detection, and visualized insights through Tableau to enhance data quality oversight.

My academic projects include designing SQL-based financial dashboards to assess credit card fraud risk, predicting heart attack probability using R-based machine learning models, and modeling telecom customer churn with Python and Power BI.

I currently volunteer as a Community Budget Advisory Committee member for Multnomah County in the Portland area of Oregon, where I contribute to budget review and provide community informed feedback to support transparent and equitable public resource allocation.

Proficient in Python, R, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Excel, I excel at transforming raw data into actionable insights that improve business performance, strengthen compliance, and guide strategic decisions. Passionate about leveraging analytics to drive operational efficiency and innovation across organizations.

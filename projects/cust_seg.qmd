## Overview

Businesses operating in competitive markets must constantly refine their marketing strategies to attract and retain customers effectively. Understanding who the customers are, what they value, and how they behave is central to making data-driven marketing decisions.

This project focuses on developing a customer segmentation framework that enables businesses to deliver personalized marketing campaigns. Using customer attributes such as demographics, purchase history, and behavioral data, we applied K-Means clustering to group existing customers into distinct segments with shared characteristics.

Once the segments were identified, a predictive classification model was trained to assign future customers to the most relevant segment. Additionally, a discount usage prediction model was built to estimate the likelihood of each customer using a discount during purchase. Combining these insights allows businesses to allocate marketing resources efficiently, tailor promotional content to each group, and optimize overall revenue potential.

By transforming raw customer data into actionable insights, the project demonstrates how segmentation and predictive modeling can improve marketing effectiveness and reduce unnecessary spending.

## Problem Statement

Traditional marketing strategies often rely on a one-size-fits-all approach, where the same campaigns are shown to all customers regardless of their needs or behaviors. This results in **inefficient resource allocation** and **lower customer engagement**, as not all customers respond similarly to identical offers.

The key problem addressed in this project is how to **identify meaningful customer segments** and **predict future customer behavior** to support data-driven marketing decisions. Specifically, this project aims to answer the following questions:

1. How can we categorize customers into well-defined groups that share similar characteristics or purchase behaviors?  
2. How can we build a model to accurately assign new customers to these segments?  
3. How can we predict which customers are most likely to use discounts, enabling businesses to target incentives strategically?

By solving these challenges, this project provides a scalable analytical framework for **personalized marketing**, helping businesses maximize both customer satisfaction and profitability.


## Data
This project uses the customer features dataset named "Customer Shopping Trends Dataset" from Kaggle. This dataset describes demographics, purchasing behavior, product preferences, and promotional interactions. Key variables include age, gender, purchase amount, payment method, purchase frequency, and customer review ratings, along with information on items purchased, shopping season, and discount usage.

The dataset provides a structured foundation for analyzing customer behavior, supporting customer segmentation, predictive modeling, and data-driven marketing strategies.

**Snapshot**

* Records: 3,900 customers

* Features: 15 columns

**Preprocessing summary**

* Applied Z score normalization to all numerical variables using StandardScaler to ensure consistent scaling.  

* Categorized categorical features into three groups: binary, ordinal multi category, and non ordinal multi category variables.  

* Converted binary variables into numerical values of 0 and 1.  

* Encoded ordinal categorical variables into integer values that preserve their natural order using LabelEncoder.  

* Transformed non ordinal categorical variables into dummy variables and removed the original categorical columns.  

* Removed the Promo Code Used feature since it was an exact duplicate of Discount Applied to avoid double counting promotional effects.  

* Dropped Customer ID prior to modeling because identifier variables do not contain meaningful predictive information and may cause overfitting.

## Key Methods and Approach
To identify patterns in customer shopping behavior and derive actionable insights for data-driven, targeted marketing strategies, our project leveraged a K-Means clustering algorithm. By utilizing this unsupervised machine learning technique, we were able to identify distinct customer groups based on purchasing behaviors and demographic profile- thus supporting our data-driven decision-making for personalized marketing and customer engagement initiatives.

#### Model Selection
* Selected K Means clustering as the primary method for customer segmentation.  

* Chosen due to the unsupervised nature of the problem, as customer groups were not predefined.  

* Well suited for a mid sized dataset with 3,900 records, offering computational efficiency and scalability.  

* Provides clear and interpretable cluster results that support business driven insights.  

* Effective after preprocessing, as all features were transformed into numerical formats compatible with Euclidean distance calculations.

#### Evaluation Metrics
* Evaluated clustering performance using metrics designed specifically for unsupervised learning.  

* Used **Within Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)** to measure cluster compactness and cohesion.  
  * Calculated WCSS across a wide range of cluster counts from 2 to 99.  
  * Applied the Elbow Method to identify diminishing returns as k increased.  

* Used **Silhouette Score** to assess both cluster cohesion and separation.  
  * Values range from -1 to 1, with higher scores indicating better defined clusters.  
  * Used to validate the optimal number of clusters selected using WCSS.  

* Combined WCSS and Silhouette Score to balance intra cluster compactness and inter cluster separation, ensuring meaningful and interpretable customer segments.

#### Model Tuning
* Applied the **Elbow Method** with the KneeLocator library to automatically identify the optimal number of clusters based on diminishing returns in WCSS.  

* Validated the selected number of clusters using **Silhouette Scores** computed across the tested k range.  
  * Confirmed consistency when both metrics converged on similar k values.  

* Performed **cluster interpretation and feature variance analysis** after finalizing the model.  
  * Identified key variables that differentiated customer segments.  
  * Ensured clusters were not only statistically sound but also meaningful from a business perspective.

## Results and Findings
Using K Means clustering, the dataset was segmented into **25 distinct customer clusters**, each representing unique combinations of demographics, shopping behaviors, and purchasing preferences. These clusters reveal meaningful differences in how customers interact with products, promotions, and payment channels, enabling targeted and data driven marketing strategies.

#### Key Trends Across Customer Clusters

* **Age Distribution**  
  * Several clusters are dominated by younger shoppers between ages 18 and 25.  
  * Other clusters skew toward older customers aged 50 and above, reflecting different purchasing priorities and behaviors.

* **Purchase Frequency and Spending Patterns**  
  * Some clusters represent high engagement customers who shop frequently and spend larger amounts per transaction.  
  * Other clusters consist of low engagement customers characterized by infrequent purchases and lower spending levels.

* **Promotions and Seasonality**  
  * Multiple clusters show strong responsiveness to discounts and seasonal promotions.  
  * In contrast, certain clusters display consistent shopping behavior throughout the year with minimal sensitivity to promotions or seasonality.

* **Shopping Channel and Payment Preferences**  
  * Younger customer clusters tend to prefer online shopping and digital payment methods such as eWallets and credit cards.  
  * Older customer clusters are more likely to favor in store purchases and traditional payment methods including cash and debit cards.

#### Top Differentiating Features Across Clusters

The following variables were identified as the most influential in distinguishing customer segments:

* Age  
* Purchase Amount in USD  
* Purchase Frequency  
* Preferred Payment Method  
* Discount Applied  
* Shopping Season Preference

**Key Observations from Sample Clusters**

1. Clusters vary significantly in age, spending power, and loyalty, ranging from high spending fashion forward customers to budget conscious frequent shoppers.

2. Some clusters respond strongly to discounts and promotions, while others are more motivated by quality, exclusivity, and brand experience.

3. Younger clusters tend to show higher engagement frequency but lower spend per transaction, whereas older clusters often demonstrate stronger loyalty and higher purchase amounts.

4. Size inclusivity, customer experience, and post purchase engagement emerged as important drivers for several segments.

## Conclusion
The successful development of the customer segmentation and segment prediction models enables businesses to clearly identify and understand distinct customer groups. The clustering model uncovers meaningful patterns in customer behavior, while the prediction model allows new and existing customers to be accurately assigned to the appropriate segment.

Together, these models support personalized marketing strategies by aligning promotions, messaging, and product recommendations with specific customer segments. They also strengthen customer retention efforts by highlighting at risk groups and informing targeted engagement initiatives. Ultimately, the insights generated from this analysis help retail businesses improve inventory planning, refine sales strategies, and build stronger, long term customer relationships.

## Business Implications

This project demonstrates how data driven customer segmentation can directly support smarter business decisions. By understanding customer behavior at a segment level, businesses can allocate marketing resources more efficiently, reduce ineffective discounting, and improve campaign performance.

The ability to predict customer segments also enables proactive retention strategies, more accurate inventory planning, and tailored product offerings. Overall, these insights help organizations increase revenue, enhance customer satisfaction, and build sustainable, long term growth.

## Next Steps

Future enhancements to this project could focus on refining cluster stability and expanding predictive capabilities. This includes experimenting with alternative clustering methods, incorporating additional behavioral or time based features, and retraining models with new data to capture evolving customer preferences.

Further steps may also include integrating real time data for dynamic segmentation, conducting A B testing to measure the impact of segment specific marketing strategies, and deploying the models into a production environment to support ongoing business decision making.
